# landing-page-goodreams
A landing page for a school assignment.

Deploy: https://goodreams.netlify.app/

Made in 2021 for a school assignment that should contain 1 page explaining the content, save user and product data and then show it on another screen.

The website's purpose is to be a sleep calculator that shows you the best time to wake up after you select the time you want to sleep.

Here is the landing page part of the project. (Responsive on desktop screens only.)
